# semantic.object
With this framework project we aim to create: 
  1. a cross platform mobile enabled web-based front-end capable of reading oject oriented domains and creating an app from them,
  2. a server side implementation capable of reading oject oriented domains and providing durability and persistance and
  3. an english language based semantic framework that enforces semantic guardrails for developers who use this framework.
  
Let the games begin.
