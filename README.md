# semantic.object
With this framework project we aim to create: 
  1. a mobile enabled GWT+ERRAI front-end capable of reading oject oriented domains and creating an app from them
  2. a graph plus relational database implementation capable of reading oject oriented domains and providing persistence for them
  3. an english language based sematic framework that enforces semantic guardrails for developers who use this framework.
  
Let the games begin.
