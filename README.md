# semantic.object
With this framework project we aim to create: 
  1. a cross platform mobile enabled web-based front-end capable of reading oject oriented domains and creating an app from them
  2. a graph plus relational database implementation capable of reading oject oriented domains and providing durability
  3. an english language based sematic framework that enforces semantic guardrails for developers who use this framework.
  
Let the games begin.
